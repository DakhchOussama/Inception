# Inception

## 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to Project Inception! This project focuses on the integration of DevOps practices, Docker, environment variables, Docker containers, cryptography, TCP, FTP, and NGINX. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you understand and contribute to the project.

## 🔧 DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations to achieve continuous delivery with high software quality. It aims to streamline the systems development life cycle.

## 🐳 Docker

Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update, and manage containers. Containers are standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system libraries and dependencies.

### 🐋 Docker Container

![Docker Container](https://www.knowledgehut.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2o2utebsixu4k.cloudfront.net%2Fmedia%2Fimages%2F1658988818513-Image-1.png&w=3840&q=75)

A container is a cohesive software unit that packages up code and its dependencies. It allows for the quick and reliable deployment of applications across different environments.

Learn more about containers and their features in the [documentation](https://www.example.com/documentation).

## 🛡️ Cryptography

Cryptography involves securing data using encryption and decryption. In symmetric cryptography, a single key is used. For example:

```plaintext
Ciphertext + Key = Plaintext
X5xJCSycg14= + 2jd8932kd8 = hello
```
## 🌐 TCP

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a communications standard for exchanging messages over a network. It divides data into segments, transmits them, and ensures reliable delivery.

Learn more about TCP in the [TCP documentation](https://example.com/tcp-docs).

## 📂 FTP

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol for transferring files between hosts over a TCP-based network. It uses a client-server architecture.

## 🔄 NGINX

NGINX is open-source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, and more. It operates with low memory usage and high concurrency.
